Notes for CodeWorks Intro to Python

Hello, and welcome!

This is now a collection of programs that we complete in class.

I know, it would be more helpful for you to have notes, but, from now on, you're going to need to take your own notes.

It will help you more to have the notes for yourself, and written in a way that you can quickly understand.

Anyway, as always, my slack is, as always, open for questions.
