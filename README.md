Notes for CodeWorks Intro to Python

Hello, and welcome!

I've been working on this collection of notes since the beginning of this class, and now I am finally able to share them with you all.

This repository contains notes about everything you need to know so far. 

I have added comments and examples to help you better understand the material.

In addition, there are a few example programs that are from class activities that we have done.

If anything is confusion, or you think my notes should be more clear, make sure to let me know!
